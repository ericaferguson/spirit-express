Examples showing popular and common Express middleware.

The examples also make use of [spirit-router](https://github.com/spirit-js/spirit-router) just to showcase a common working example. But any compatible spirit handler or router can be used.

Remember to `npm install` in this directory to install the relevant dependencies to run the examples.
